My first repository

Hello!

I'm relativly new to programming, but already made a Windows program as WPF-App for joiners. I want to be porting my program in Java/JavaFX/FXML, so it is platform independent and learn GitHub at the same time. Sadly my ability to write and speak in english isn't as good as my skills in understanding the language yet.
