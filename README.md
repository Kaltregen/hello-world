Hello!

I'm relatively new to programming, but already made a Windows program as WPF-App for joiners. It makes calculating compound miters easy and can even calculate more complex compund miters where one board has a negative tilt angle. Sadly my ability to write and speak in english isn't as good as my skills in understanding the language yet.
