Hello!

I'm relativly new to programming, but already made a Windows program as WPF-App for joiners. It makes calculating compound miters easy and can even calculate more complex compund miters where one board has a negative tilt angle. I want to be porting my program in Java/JavaFX/FXML, so it is platform independent and learn GitHub at the same time. Sadly my ability to write and speak in english isn't as good as my skills in understanding the language yet.
